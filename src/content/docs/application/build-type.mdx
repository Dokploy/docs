## Build Types

Dokploy offers three distinct build types for deploying applications, each suited to different development needs and preferences.


### Nixpacks

This is the default build type in Dokploy. When you select Nixpacks, Dokploy builds your application as a Nixpack, which is optimized for ease of use and efficiency.

### Dockerfile

If your project includes a Dockerfile, you can specify its path. Dokploy will use this Dockerfile to build your application directly, giving you full control over the build environment and dependencies.

### Buildpack

Dokploy supports two types of buildpacks:

- **Heroku**: Adapted from Heroku's popular cloud platform, these buildpacks are designed for compatibility and ease of migration.
- **Paketo**: Provides cloud-native buildpacks that leverage modern standards and practices for building applications.


<Aside>   
    **Tip:** We recommend using the `Nixpacks` build type as it is the most straightforward and commonly used option for most applications.

By choosing the appropriate build type, you can tailor the deployment process to best fit your application's requirements and your operational preferences.
