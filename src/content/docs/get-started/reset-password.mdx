## Reset Password

To reset your password, follow these steps:

1. Log in in to your VPS.
2. Run `docker ps` to get the container ID of the dokploy container.
3. Run `docker exec -it <container-id> bash -c "pnpm run reset-password"` to open a shell in the dokploy container.
4. It will display a random password. Copy it and use it to access again to the dashboard.
