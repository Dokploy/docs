{/* create a list please of the steps */}

You need to follow this steps in the same order:

1. [Virtual Private Server (VPS)](#virtual-private-server-vps)
2. [Docker](#docker)

## Virtual Private Server (VPS)

There are multiple VPS providers to choose from. Here is a list of the most common VPS providers:

We have tested on two Linux Distros:

- Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
- Debian 10

### Providers

- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#basic-droplets)
- [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/)
- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/es/pricing/#compute-shared)
- [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/pricing/#cloud-compute)
- [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=baremetal,available)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/)

### Requirements

To ensure a smooth experience with Dokploy, your server should have at least 2GB of RAM and 30GB of disk space. This specification helps to handle the resources consumed by Docker during builds and prevents system freezes.

<Aside type="tip">

**Suggestion:** For cost efficiency with reliable service, we recommend Hetzner as the best value-for-money VPS provider.

### Docker

Dokploy utilizes Docker, so it is essential to have Docker installed on your server. If Docker is not already installed, use the following command to install it automatically:

```bash
curl -sSL https://dokploy.com/install.sh | sh
```

## Completing the Setup

After running the installation script, Dokploy and its dependencies will be set up on your server. Here's how to finalize the setup and start using Dokploy:

### Accessing Dokploy

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://your-ip-from-your-vps:3000`. You will be directed to the initial setup page where you can configure the administrative account for Dokploy.

### Initial Configuration

1. **Create an Admin Account:** Fill in the necessary details to set up your administrator account. This account will be the admin account for Dokploy.
