To set up a web domain for your Dokploy account, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your VPS.
2. Run `docker ps` to get the container ID of the dokploy container.
3. Run `docker exec -it <container-id> bash -c "pnpm run web-domain-setup"` to open a shell in the dokploy container.
4. It will display a random password. Copy it and use it to access again to the dashboard.
