Dokploy relies on Docker, specifically on `Docker Swarm`, to deploy your applications.

We provide a simple way to see all the containers running in your server.

to see all the containers running in your server you can go to `/dashboard/docker` route.

You have 3 actions you can perform on your containers.

- `View Logs`  will show you the logs of the container.
- `View Config`  will show you the configuration of the container.
- `Terminal`  will open a terminal in the container.
