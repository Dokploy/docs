title: Build Type
---

In Dokploy  you can choose between 3 different build types.

- **Nixpacks**: This is the default build type, it will build your application as a Nixpack.
- **Dockerfile**: If you have a Dockerfile in your repository, you can specify the path to the Dockerfile.
- **Buildpack**: We provide two types of buildpacks, `Heroku` and `Paketo`.


<Tip>   
    We recommend using the `Nixpacks` build type, it is the most common and easy to use.
