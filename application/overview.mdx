Dokploy includes multiples ways to deploy applications.

- Github
- Git (Any Git Provider)
- Docker


## Github

The easiest way to deploy your application is to use Github. 

You can configure your Github Repository in `/dashboard/settings/server` route.

And when you create a application it will automatically load the repository and branches.


## Git

If you want to deploy your application from a any Git Repository that is private or public you can use the Git option, you can use SSH or HTTPS.

It will ask you to enter the repository URL and the branch you want to deploy.



## Docker

Specify a docker image, in the case of a private repository you can provide the username and password.



## Auto Deploy

You can configure your application to auto deploy on any action, for example when you push a new commit to your repository.

To configure this you can go to `deployments` Tab and you will see a `Webhook URL`, copy this URL.


For any Git provider, is very common that the repository have a Webhook Tab that you can insert any URL.

So copy the URL and paste it in the Webhook URL field.

It will ask what events you want to trigger the deployment, select the `Push` event.

And you are done, your application will be deployed automatically when you push a new commit to your repository.

Currently we support the webhooks from Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket and Gitea, also for DockerHub.
