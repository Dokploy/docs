Dokploy provides several ways to deploy applications, simplifying the process whether you're using GitHub, any Git provider, Docker, or automated deployments.


- Github
- Git (Any Git Provider)
- Docker


## GitHub

Deploying via GitHub is straightforward:

1. Configure your GitHub repository under `/dashboard/settings/server`.
2. When creating an application, Dokploy automatically loads the available repositories and branches.

## Git

For deployments from any Git repository, public or private, you can use either SSH or HTTPS:

1. Provide the repository URL.
2. Specify the branch you wish to deploy.


## Docker

For Docker deployments:

- Specify a Docker image. For private repositories, you'll need to provide the username and password.


## Auto Deploy

Set up automatic deployments:

1. Navigate to the `deployments` tab and copy the `Webhook URL`.
2. In your Git provider's settings, paste this URL into the Webhook URL field.
3. Choose the events that should trigger deployments, such as `Push`.
4. Once configured, any specified action, like pushing a new commit, will automatically trigger a deployment.

Dokploy supports webhooks from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea, and DockerHub.
