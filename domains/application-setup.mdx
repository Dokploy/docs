## Introduction

This guide details how to set up a domain for your application.

## Requirements

If you do not have a domain, refer to the `Web Domain Setup` section first.

## Create DNS Record

1. Add an `A` record to your DNS settings:
   - **Name:** Enter the route you want to point to (e.g., `app` for `app.yourdomain.com`).
   - **Value:** Type in the IP address of your server, such as `1.2.3.4`.

## Application Domain Setup

1. Navigate to your application's dashboard.
2. Go to the `Domains` tab and click on `Add Domain`.
3. Enter the DNS record you created in the previous step (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`).

<Info>
    **Note:** Set the container port to the port where your application is running.
</Info>

Wait 20-30 seconds for Traefik to generate the certificate, after which you can access your application through your newly set domain.

Go to any application and go to `Domains` tab and click on `Add Domain`, and simply type the record you created in the previous step.

Give them 20-30 seconds to traefik generate the certificate and be able to access your application through your domain.
